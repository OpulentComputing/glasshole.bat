glasshole.bat
=============

glasshole for windows dhcp server 

glasshole.bat with Windows Server 2012 R2, 2012, 2008 R2, 2008 DHCP Server.

This batch fill will block any device with in the a MAC address from glasshole.sh range from obtaining an IP from the Windows DHCP Server.

This batch script has been tested on Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2012.

!!!!!It may still be possible for the g00gle glass device to get on your network by them knowing the subnet and entering a static ip on the device.!!!! But lets face it most glassholes have no idea what a subnet or static ip is ;)

@JulianOliver glasshole.sh gave me the idea for this thank you!
